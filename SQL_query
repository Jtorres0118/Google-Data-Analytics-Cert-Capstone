--DESCRIPTION: This code is how I queried the code I used for the R files. 

--Creates a temporary table to be split by all the homes with 1 adult and 2 adults for further comparison between the number of children and cost of living (will be done in R)
--Ensures a duplicate table doesn't exist
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS child_cost;
--Initializes table
CREATE TEMP TABLE child_cost AS
--pulls all relevant columns from the dataset
SELECT  state,
        county,
        Number_children,
        Number_adults,
        Family_Size,
        housing_cost,
        food_cost,
        transportation_cost,
        healthcare_cost,
        other_necessities_cost,
        childcare_cost,
        taxes,
        total_cost,
        median_family_income
FROM steam-curve-456913-e6.Test_county_data.Test_county_table
--sorts by state name, county name, and number of children
ORDER BY state, county, Number_children;
SELECT * FROM child_cost
